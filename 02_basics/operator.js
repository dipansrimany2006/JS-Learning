// In this file we will learn about the operators.
// there re 6 types of operators- like '+','-','*','/','increment','decrement'.
// this are the basics operators, after this we will learn other type of operators:

//Examples of operators
let a=5,b=2;
console.log("a=",a);
console.log("b=",b);
console.log("a+b=",a+b); //Addition operator
console.log("a-b=",a-b); //Subtraction operator
console.log("a*b=",a*b); //Multiplication Operator
console.log("a/b=",a/b); //Division Operator
console.log("a%b=",a%b); // Modulus Operator or Remainder Operator
a++//Increment Operator
console.log("Now after use increment operator 'a'=",a);
b-- //Decrement operator
console.log("Now after use decrement operator 'b'=",b);

// There are so many operators like assignment operators, logical operators.
// this all same as in Java and C language.
// Dipan You already know about this logical operators so, I am no discussing this things here.
